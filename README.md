## Retail Price Analysis and Prediction

        This project dives into understanding retail pricing patterns and predicting total
        prices based on key features like quantity, unit price, competitor pricing, and more.
        It uses data visualization and machine learning to uncover insights and build a
        predictive model.

        Features
            1) Data Visualization

                    Histogram of total prices to explore distribution.
                    Scatter plots to study relationships between variables.
                    Box plots to identify outliers in price trends by product category and weekdays.
                    Correlation heatmap to understand numerical feature interactions.
            2) Competitor Price Analysis

                    Calculated the difference between unit prices and competitor prices.
                    Visualized average price differences by product categories.

            3) Machine Learning

                    Decision Tree Regressor: Used to predict the total price based on factors like quantity, unit price, competitor price, and product score.

        Whatâ€™s Inside?

            Interactive Visualizations: Built with Plotly for dynamic and visually appealing charts.
            Predictive Model: Trained a Decision Tree Regressor to accurately estimate total prices.
            Evaluation: Compared predicted prices with actual values using scatter plots for intuitive understanding.


        Why Decision Tree Regressor?

            The Decision Tree Regressor is a flexible, non-linear model. It works well for datasets with varying distributions and captures relationships between features without needing extensive preprocessing.

        Skills Demonstrated

                Data Cleaning and Analysis: Used Pandas and NumPy for structured data manipulation.
                Interactive Visualizations: Created detailed insights using Plotly.
                Machine Learning: Leveraged sklearn for building and evaluating models.
                Feature Engineering: Added new features like price difference with competitors.
